# BirdBingo
Bird Bingo game for CAPSHER

## Quick Start
1. Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), I developed with `3.12.2`
2. Create a Python virtual environment to keep this project's dependencies separate from your machine's dependencies. You can also do this through VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask
3. If not already installed by creating the virtual environment, install python packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Use VSCode's `Python Debugger: Flask` configuration. This will launch the app with VSCode debugging and open a web browser.
   - If not using VSCode, documentation on how to run and debug python Flask apps are readily available online.

## Resources used
The following is a list of resources I used to set up the app:
